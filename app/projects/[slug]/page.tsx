        content: "Object Formatter started as a small side project to simplify one of the most common annoyances in development ‚Äî viewing, formatting, and comparing JSON, XML, and YAML data. I built it to solve a personal pain point: switching between multiple tools and tabs just to inspect different data structures. The goal was simple ‚Äî create a fast, modern, and visually clean web app that lets users format, validate, and view objects instantly in any format, all within a single, minimal interface.\n\nI envisioned Object Formatter as more than just a \"pretty printer.\" I wanted it to feel like a developer's everyday companion ‚Äî something lightweight enough to open in a browser within seconds but powerful enough to handle complex, deeply nested objects.",
      },
      {
        title: "Tech Stack",
        content: "I built the application using React for the front end and hosted it on Vercel for performance and simplicity. The app leverages Next.js for its hybrid static-dynamic rendering, ensuring fast load times and efficient SEO handling.\n\nFor the formatting and parsing logic, I used Prettier and js-yaml for JSON and YAML conversions, and xml-formatter for XML beautification.\n\nStyling was inspired by the clean, dark aesthetics of Vercel's own site ‚Äî sleek typography, subtle animations, and an auto dark/light theme switcher built with Tailwind CSS. The design goal was to make it visually elegant yet distraction-free.",
      },

        title: "Challenges",
        content: "Early on, one of the biggest challenges was managing large data payloads. Many formatters freeze or lag when processing files over a few megabytes, especially when performing bi-directional conversions (like YAML ‚Üî JSON). I had to optimize the rendering process using React.memo and Web Workers to keep the interface smooth and responsive.\n\nAnother challenge was maintaining formatting accuracy when converting between formats. YAML in particular introduced difficulties due to indentation sensitivity and anchors. Ensuring that data wasn't lost or altered during transformation required a lot of testing and comparison logic.\n\nFinally, I wanted the tool to feel modern ‚Äî not like a basic textarea with a \"format\" button. Designing an intuitive split-view interface where users could visualize raw and formatted data simultaneously took several iterations in Figma.",
      },
      {
        title: "Solution",
        content: "After refining the UI and performance, I implemented a three-panel layout: input, output, and a format selector. Users can paste or upload data, choose a format, and instantly view the parsed output. I also added smart detection ‚Äî the app automatically recognizes the structure type (JSON, XML, or YAML) and formats it accordingly.\n\nTo make it even more practical, I integrated copy, download, and share options, plus a future-ready mode for diff comparison between two objects. The goal was not just a viewer, but a developer utility that feels effortless to use.",

The tool was born out of necessity ‚Äî during the company's nationwide Dynamics 365 rollout, our support team often dealt with massive 200‚Äì700 MB log files containing crucial transaction data. Manual inspection was slow, error-prone, and frustrating.\n\nI created LD Crimson Inspector to transform that process. The idea was to make log analysis as simple as searching a web page ‚Äî with instant filtering, pattern detection, and intelligent grouping of events.",

        title: "Tech Stack",

It supports offline operation, meaning it can analyze logs without network access ‚Äî critical for secure store environments.\n\nKey libraries include re (regex) for pattern recognition, threading for performance, and Pandas for data handling. I also integrated custom parsers that identify timestamps, SAF (Store And Forward) codes, and transaction threads.",
      },
      {
        title: "Challenges",
        content: "The main challenge was performance. A typical Crimson log could exceed 500 MB, and naive line-by-line parsing would take minutes. I had to rewrite the parser to process data in chunks using memory-efficient generators.\n\nAnother challenge was the diversity of log structures. Each file had slightly different message patterns and timestamps, requiring flexible pattern detection instead of fixed rules.\n\nFinally, the UI design ‚Äî balancing readability with dense data ‚Äî was a struggle. I wanted a modern, dark-mode-friendly interface that technicians could use comfortably for hours.",

It automatically identifies transaction boundaries, error codes, and SAF events, then organizes them into a searchable timeline.\n\nThe interface lets users jump between transactions, view failure summaries, and filter by keywords or timestamps. I also added export features to CSV and HTML so findings could be shared in reports.",
